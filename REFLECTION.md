1.regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?

Yes, estimating tasks has really improved my accuracy and productivity.

2.regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?

I think it works when the code is reviewed, which helps me get more efficient algorithms and checks for buggy code.

3.regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Taking a step-by-step approach and providing some examples and solutions will bring a better experience to the whole code learning.
